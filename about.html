			<h2>Our story</h2>
<div style="white-space: pre-wrap">
The Richmond Outdoor was held for the very first time in 2015, and has since grown into a key event on the calendars of outdoor enthusiasts all over South Africa. Held in and around the scenic and historic town of Richmond in the Upper Karoo, the Richmond Outdoor is demanding and unifying, rugged and rustic, competitive and accommodating. The safety and wellbeing of all participants are of paramount importance to the organisers, and all possible measures have been undertaken to ensure this.

The Richmond Outdoor is a family-oriented event and provides an outdoor experience to both the race-fit, and those who prefer to just kick back and enjoy the event. Whether you’re biking, running or walking, you’re sure to encounter an abundance of indigenous fauna and flora along the way. Keep an eye out for the Padloper tortoise – that always has right of way – and the kudu, springbok, dassie, baboon and meerkat. Should you look carefully around you, you’ll be sure to see local and migratory birds aplenty. The sheer endlessness of the expanse of the Karoo plains will take your breath away – but fear not, for you will be inhaling the purest oxygen that our country can offer.

Visitors and participants are invited to stay in the Richmond Outdoor’s top-quality race village, where tented accommodation will allow you to mingle and experience the firmament at night – and we promise you haven’t seen stars like these before. Come and breathe the unpolluted air, rub shoulders around the fires of a braai, and taste our incomparable and world-famous Karoo lamb. A range of exceptional accommodation is available to participants who prefer to sleep indoors. We are also glad to announce that the Happy Grannies will be available to keep an eye on the kids for the duration of the event, while mom and dad participate. 

Be active. 

It’s not an event, it’s a lifestyle.

		<h2>Our sponsors & mission</h2>
<div style="white-space: pre-wrap">
The Richmond Outdoor is grateful for the continuing and valuable support from our main sponsor, Delfin Financial Services. 

The Richmond Outdoor believes that corporate social investment is the backbone of a community. Consequently, the Richmond Outdoor will continue to strive to ensure that there is an increased benefit to the entire community of Richmond as we grow this event. It is envisaged that in time there will be a positive influence in the lives of all communities of Richmond through the impact of this event.

We are privileged to collaborate with Grassroots Hope in South Africa, an organisation that focuses on enabling the poorest children of Richmond to reach their full potential by way of a feeding scheme, educational assistance and sports orientated programs. One of the challenges this organisation has is to keep children away from the alcohol and drug vices that are prevalent in this society and this is best achieved through various sport programs managed by dedicated coaches. In view of this challenge, we respectfully request that visitors and participants, in this event, kindly bring along any old or unused sports equipment, sports clothes, sports shoes etc. that can be put to good use in this endeavour. After the event, the organisers will donate all that is received to <a href="http://www.hopeinsouthafrica.com/" target="_blank">Grassroots</a> on your behalf. This will also be published on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRichmondOutdoor/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.

In conclusion, our mission is to ensure that this gem of a town, Richmond in the Karoo, benefits from your participation in this healthy, family-orientated event in the most positive manner. Not only do we want you to have an amazing experience, but we would also like to make this event an annual event in your outdoor calendar. We look forward to welcoming you and seeing your footprints and bicycle tracks in our pristine Karoo that we would like to share with you.
