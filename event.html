		<h4>3-day MTB stage race</h4>
		<p>
			Day 1: Prologue (+/– 25km)<br />
			Day 2: Stage 1 (+/– 75km)<br />

		<p>The 3-day MTB Stage Race is open to two-member teams, although solo participants
can take part in the main race on Day 3 (75km) or take part in a 55km race on the
same day.</p>
<p>The route traverses the rugged topography that is characteristic of the Karoo, and
includes rocky terrain, jeep tracks and district and farm roads. The route isn’t
particularly technical in the sense of it also having the sharp turns and obstacles of
single-track routes, but challenges riders due to the extreme ruggedness of the terrain.
Meals and tented accommodation in the race village are included in the entry fee.</p>
